# AR-Furniture-Placer
Furniture Placer
This a minimal viable product of a furniture placer app, all within AR.
Using Unity and the cross-platform development package AR Foundation.

this interior design app allows the user to view certain furniture such as sofa and table in their home.
this app also allows the user to change color, scale and rotation.

What I didi:

Set up UI elements to work with AR applications
Spawn virtual objects and snap them to planes
Select spawned objects and move them
Alter virtual objectsâ€™ color, rotation, and more
